## Data Cleaning and Transformation

This stage began with creating a working sheet and transforming the datasets presented in different sheets into "Tables". After this we start getting to explore the data and check for any data quality issues.

2.	Removing duplicates, and irrelevant columns.
3.	Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
4.	Using Vlookup function to find the customer name, email.country, coffee type, roast type,size unit price, loyalty card from the customers and products table.
5.	Created “Sales” column by calculation and “Coffee Type Name” and “Roast Type Name” columns by using IF function.

## Data Analysis

pivot tables were created to summarise the data and help identify trends in the dataset focusing on relationship between sales and factors such as date, customers, country, coffe type, coffee size. 

## Data Visualization

Finally, the dashboard was created by inserting and customizing the pivot charts of corresponding pivot table on a separate sheet named “Dashboard”. For user friendly and interactive experience 3 "Slicers" and 1 “Timeline” were added.

Below is a snippet of the final dashboard in Excel.
