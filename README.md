## Data Cleaning and Transformation

This stage began with creating a working sheet and transforming the datasets presented in different sheets into Tables After this we start exploring the data and checking for any data quality issues.
1.	Checking NULL values, blanks, and Errors.
2.	Removing duplicates and irrelevant columns.
3.	Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format, and values used.
4.	Using Xlookup function to find the customer name, email.country, coffee type, roast type, size unit price, customer loyalty card, and products table.
5.	Created the “Sales” column by calculation and the “Coffee Type Name” and “Roast Type Name” columns by using the IF function.

## Data Analysis

Pivot tables were created to summarise the data and help identify trends in the dataset, focusing on the relationship between sales and factors such as date, customers, country, coffee type, and coffee size. 

## Data Visualization

Finally, the dashboard was created by inserting and customizing the pivot charts of the corresponding pivot table on a separate sheet named “Dashboard.” Slicers and Timeline were added to create a user-friendly and interactive experience.

Below is a snippet of the final dashboard in Excel.
